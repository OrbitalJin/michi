# michi

A blazing-fast, local search multiplexer for your browser. Navigate the web with custom bangs, shortcuts, and session launchers, all powered by a tiny, self-hosted Go service.

## Features
- Shortcuts: Create, list, and delete shortcuts to quickly access frequently used URLs.
- Sessions: Create, list, and delete sessions to group related shortcuts together.
- Bangs: Create, list, and delete bangs to quickly access frequently used search queries.
- Local & Private: Your configurations are stored locally in a SQLite database, never leaving your machine.
- Blazing Fast: Runs as a tiny background service, providing instant redirects without any network latency or browser pop-up blockers.
- Cross-Platform: Built with Go, available for Linux, macOS (soon).

## Get Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrbitalJin/michi/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Start the Local Server

Run the `michi` HTTP server in the background:

```bash
michi serve
```

Or detach it to run it in the background:

```bash
michi serve --detach
```

The server will listen on `http://localhost:5980` by default.

> Note that you can change this port through the configuration file, under ~/.michi/config.yaml

### 3. Configure Your Browser

Set `http://localhost:5980/search?q=%s` as your browser's default search engine.

Instructions for common browsers:
*   **Zen:** `Settings > Search > Search Shortcuts`
    *  Don't forget to set michi as your default search engine at the top of the page. 
*   **Chromium:** `Settings > Search engine > Manage search engines and site search > Add`
    *   **Search engine:** `michi`
    *   **URL with %s:** `http://localhost:5980/search?q=%s`

## Usage

- Bang Search:
```bash
!g my Go query
!yt epic jdm cars drifting
!gh michi
```

- Web Shortcut:
```bash 
#portal
#book
#repos
```

- Session Launcher:

> All prefixes can be customized in the configuration file, under ~/.michi/config.yaml
